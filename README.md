This project is concerned with nonparametric Bayesian methods and applications. 
These methods offer an alternative to traditional parametric models, where the number of para- meters is fixed and the model assumes a specific form for the underlying distribution. 
Nonparametric Bayesian methods, on the other hand, allow for a more flexible and ad- aptive modeling approach, where the complexity of the model grows with the amount of data 
and can learn the underlying structure of the data without imposing strong assumptions. In this project, we investigate popular nonparametric Bayesian methods, 
including Dirichlet process, Chinese restaurant process, Stick-breaking process, and Po ́lya tree process. We provide clustering, density estimation, 
and change-point detection ap- plications for these methods. As an extension of P ́olya tree process, we propose a novel approach which outperforms the classic and 
mainstream nonparametric Bayesian meth- ods for Copula function estimation. We also highlight the advantages and limitations of these methods and provide insights into 
future directions for research in this area.
